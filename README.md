# Node.js with MongoDB

### Starting the Application with Docker Containers:

1. Install Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac (If you're on Windows 7 install Docker Toolbox: http://docker.com/toolbox).

2. Open a command prompt.

3. Run the commands listed in `node.dockerfile` (see the comments at the top of the file).

4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000. Use http://192.168.99.100:8080 in your browser to view the site if using Docker toolbox. This assumes that's the IP assigned to VirtualBox - change if needed.


### Starting the Application with Docker Compose

1. Install Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac (If you're on Windows 7 install Docker Toolbox: http://docker.com/toolbox). 


2. Open a command prompt at the root of the application's folder.

   Install the docker-compose using commands
    -> sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

    -> sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

    -> sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

3. Run `docker-compose build`

4. Run `docker-compose up`

5. Open another command prompt and run `docker ps -a` and note the ID of the Node container

6. Run `docker exec -it <nodeContainerID> sh` (replace <nodeContainerID> with the proper ID) to sh into the container

7. Run `node dbSeeder.js` to seed the MongoDB database

8. Type `exit` to leave the sh session

9. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (http://192.168.99.100:3000 if using Docker Toolbox) in your browser to view the site. This assumes that's the IP assigned to VirtualBox - change if needed.

10. Run `docker-compose down` to stop the containers and remove them.
